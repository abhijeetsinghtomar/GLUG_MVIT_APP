A place to work towards our failures together and also, beam happily in our successes together. And to be more precise, this community works as a guide for the fresher's in this industry. Helping with any sort of queries that the fresher's face, has always been this society's pillar. Also, a few may describe this society of ours, to be a fun place- where everyday is a new adventure which involves fun and also competitions, this striving us to be better than what we are.With the club being built, people required a particular direction to go forward. To look into different aspects of free software. And hence, FSMK gave the people their required directions. Building step by step, everyday. With words inspired from free software visionaries like Richard Stallman and Eben Moglen, members worked for it together- thus landing us up with this evolved version the GLUG club of Sir MVIT college."
